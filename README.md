The task:
Perform a quality analysis of the dataset (see Figure 2). For each continuous attribute, calculate:
the total number of values,
the percentage of missing values,
the cardinality (cardinality in mathematics is a property of a set that generalizes the concept of the number of elements of a finite set. In simpler terms, it refers to the number of different values an attribute can take. For example, the cardinality of the gender attribute is 2 - i.e., gender can only have two values),
the minimum and maximum values,
the first and third quartiles (see Lecture 2, Slide 37),
the mean (see Lecture 2, Slide 36),
the median (see Lecture 2, Slide 36),
the standard deviation (see Lecture 2, Slide 36).

For each categorical attribute, calculate:
the total number of values,
the percentage of missing values,
the cardinality,
the mode (mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset) (see Lecture 2, Slide 39),
the frequency of the mode (see Lecture 2, Slide 39),
the percentage of the mode (see Lecture 2, Slide 39),
the second mode (see Lecture 2, Slide 39),
the frequency of the second mode (see Lecture 2, Slide 39),
the percentage of the second mode (see Lecture 2, Slide 39).
Draw histograms of the attributes and provide descriptions of their distribution (e.g., normal, unimodal, exponential, etc.) and the conclusions that can be drawn from them (see Lecture 2, Slides 41-43).

Identify data quality problems, such as missing values, cardinality problems, and outliers (see Lecture 2, Slides 46-53).

Provide a plan to address these problems that will be implemented programmatically (e.g., missing categorical attribute values will be replaced using the mode of the attribute value, extreme values will be removed or corrected).

Determine relationships between attributes using visualization methods:

For continuous attributes, use a scatter plot to show two or three examples with a strong linear correlation between attributes (direct or inverse) and a few examples with weakly correlated attributes. Comment on the results. Provide a Scatter Plot Matrix (SPLOM) (see Lecture 3, Slide 5).
For categorical attributes, use a bar plot to show a few examples of attribute dependencies and comment on the results (see Lecture 3, Slides 7-9). Provide a few examples of histograms (see Lecture 3, Slides 12-14) and box plots (see Lecture 3, Slides p...)
